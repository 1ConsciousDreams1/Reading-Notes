# **Introduction**

Hello Everyone, My name is Ivan! (He, Him) I live in Seattle (PST), Capitol Hill area. I have no previous experience with coding but I am an Army veteran and have worked extensively in the Computer Information Systems Management field. My computer is running Windows 10 pro (version 21H1). I am super excited for this class not only for career advancement but I am excited to learn a new language! I speak 3 languages fluently! I am looking forward to working with you all! :-)
