## **The Importance of Text Editors and Making the Right Choice**

Text editors are a very important part of a coder's daily life. With so many text editors out there, choosing the right one may prove to be difiicult. Using a text editor makes coding easier, faster, and more reliable. With the installation of extensions, text editors become very customizable. Every coder has a different opinion on which text editor is the best, therefore, it is very important to try as many as you can and find out which one fits your coding style.

With new functions being constantly being created, text editors are in a never ending battle to claim the top spot. Sometimes its best to use a text editor for a while until new features are introduced in other programs, until eventually your favorite code editor is updated as well! In the ever changing, fast paced world of coding, its good to keep an eye out on new features that will compliment your writing style!
